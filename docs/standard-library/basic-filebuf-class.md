# basic_filebuf Class

Describes a stream buffer that controls the transmission of elements of type *Char_T*, whose character traits are determined by the class *Tr*, to and from a sequence of elements stored in an external file.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class Char_T, class Tr = char_traits<Char_T>>
class basic_filebuf : public basic_streambuf<Char_T, Tr>
```

### Parameters

*Char_T*\
The basic element of the file buffer.

*Tr*\
The traits of the basic element of the file buffer (usually `char_traits<Char_T>`).

## Remarks

The class template describes a stream buffer that controls the transmission of elements of type *Char_T*, whose character traits are determined by the class *Tr*, to and from a sequence of elements stored in an external file.

> [!NOTE]
> Objects of type `basic_filebuf` are created with an internal buffer of type __char\*__ regardless of the `char_type` specified by the type parameter *Char_T*. This means that a Unicode string (containing **wchar_t** characters) will be converted to an ANSI string (containing **char** characters) before it is written to the internal buffer. To store Unicode strings in the buffer, create a new buffer of type **wchar_t** and set it using the [`basic_streambuf::pubsetbuf`](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#pubsetbuf)`()` method. To see an example that demonstrates this behavior, see below.

An object of class `basic_filebuf<Char_T, Tr>` stores a file pointer, which designates the `FILE` object that controls the stream associated with an open file. It also stores pointers to two file conversion facets for use by the protected member functions [overflow](#overflow) and [underflow](#underflow). For more information, see [`basic_filebuf::open`](#open).

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to force an object of type `basic_filebuf<wchar_t>` to store Unicode characters in its internal buffer by calling the `pubsetbuf()` method.

```cpp
// unicode_basic_filebuf.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <memory.h>
#include <string.h>

#define IBUFSIZE 16

using namespace std;

void hexdump(const string& filename);

int main()
{
    wchar_t* wszHello = L"Hello World";
    wchar_t wBuffer[128];

    basic_filebuf<wchar_t> wOutFile;

    // Open a file, wcHello.txt, then write to it, then dump the
    // file's contents in hex
    wOutFile.open("wcHello.txt",
        ios_base::out | ios_base::trunc | ios_base::binary);
    if(!wOutFile.is_open())
    {
        cout << "Error Opening wcHello.txt\n";
        return -1;
    }
    wOutFile.sputn(wszHello, (streamsize)wcslen(wszHello));
    wOutFile.close();
    cout << "Hex Dump of wcHello.txt - note that output is ANSI chars:\n";
    hexdump(string("wcHello.txt"));

    // Open a file, wwHello.txt, then set the internal buffer of
    // the basic_filebuf object to be of type wchar_t, then write
    // to the file and dump the file's contents in hex
    wOutFile.open("wwHello.txt",
        ios_base::out | ios_base::trunc | ios_base::binary);
    if(!wOutFile.is_open())
    {
        cout << "Error Opening wwHello.txt\n";
        return -1;
    }
    wOutFile.pubsetbuf(wBuffer, (streamsize)128);
    wOutFile.sputn(wszHello, (streamsize)wcslen(wszHello));
    wOutFile.close();
    cout << "\nHex Dump of wwHello.txt - note that output is wchar_t chars:\n";
    hexdump(string("wwHello.txt"));

    return 0;
}

// dump contents of filename to stdout in hex
void hexdump(const string& filename)
{
    fstream ifile(filename.c_str(),
        ios_base::in | ios_base::binary);
    char *ibuff = new char[IBUFSIZE];
    char *obuff = new char[(IBUFSIZE*2)+1];
    int i;

    if(!ifile.is_open())
    {
        cout << "Cannot Open " << filename.c_str()
             << " for reading\n";
        return;
    }
    if(!ibuff || !obuff)
    {
        cout << "Cannot Allocate buffers\n";
        ifile.close();
        return;
    }

    while(!ifile.eof())
    {
        memset(obuff,0,(IBUFSIZE*2)+1);
        memset(ibuff,0,IBUFSIZE);
        ifile.read(ibuff,IBUFSIZE);

        // corner case where file is exactly a multiple of
        // 16 bytes in length
        if(ibuff[0] == 0 && ifile.eof())
            break;

        for(i = 0; i < IBUFSIZE; i++)
        {
            if(ibuff[i] >= ' ')
                obuff[i] = ibuff[i];
            else
                obuff[i] = '.';

            cout << setfill('0') << setw(2) << hex
                 << (int)ibuff[i] << ' ';
        }
        cout << "  " << obuff << endl;
    }
    ifile.close();
}
```

```Output
Hex Dump of wcHello.txt - note that output is ANSI chars:
48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 00 00 00 00 00   Hello World.....

## Requirements

**Header:** \<fstream>

**Namespace:** std

## <a name="basic_filebuf"></a> basic_filebuf::basic_filebuf

Constructs an object of type `basic_filebuf`.

```cpp
basic_filebuf();

basic_filebuf(basic_filebuf&& right);
```

### Remarks

The first constructor stores a null pointer in all the pointers controlling the input buffer and the output buffer. It also stores a null pointer in the file pointer.

The second constructor initializes the object with the contents of *right*, treated as an rvalue reference.

## <a name="char_type"></a> basic_filebuf::char_type

Associates a type name with the `Char_T` template parameter.

```cpp
typedef Char_T char_type;
```

## <a name="close"></a> basic_filebuf::close

Closes a file.

```cpp
basic_filebuf<Char_T, Tr> *close();
```

### Return Value

The member function returns a null pointer if the file pointer is a null pointer.

### Remarks

`close` calls `fclose(fp)`. If that function returns a nonzero value, the function returns a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns **this** to indicate that the file was successfully closed.

For a wide stream, if any insertions have occurred since the stream was opened, or since the last call to `streampos`, the function calls [`overflow`](#overflow). It also inserts any sequence needed to restore the initial conversion state, by using the file conversion facet `fac` to call `fac.unshift` as needed. Each produced element `byte` of type **char** is written to the associated stream designated by the file pointer `fp` as if by successive calls of the form `fputc(byte, fp)`. If the call to `fac.unshift` or any write fails, the function does not succeed.

### Example

The following sample assumes two files in the current directory: *basic_filebuf_close.txt* (contents is "testing") and *iotest.txt* (contents is "ssss").

```cpp
// basic_filebuf_close.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
   using namespace std;
   ifstream file;
   basic_ifstream <wchar_t> wfile;
   char c;
   // Open and close with a basic_filebuf
   file.rdbuf()->open( "basic_filebuf_close.txt", ios::in );
   file >> c;
   cout << c << endl;
   file.rdbuf( )->close( );

   // Open/close directly
   file.open( "iotest.txt" );
   file >> c;
   cout << c << endl;
   file.close( );

   // open a file with a wide character name
   wfile.open( L"iotest.txt" );

   // Open and close a nonexistent with a basic_filebuf
   file.rdbuf()->open( "ziotest.txt", ios::in );
   cout << file.fail() << endl;
   file.rdbuf( )->close( );

   // Open/close directly
   file.open( "ziotest.txt" );
   cout << file.fail() << endl;
   file.close( );
}
```

```Output
t
s
0
1
```

## <a name="int_type"></a> basic_filebuf::int_type

Makes this type within `basic_filebuf` scope equivalent to the type of the same name in the `Tr` scope.

```cpp
typedef typename traits_type::int_type int_type;
```

## <a name="is_open"></a> basic_filebuf::is_open

Indicates whether a file is open.

```cpp
bool is_open() const;
```

### Return Value

**true** if the file pointer isn't null.

### Example

```cpp
// basic_filebuf_is_open.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   ifstream file;
   cout << boolalpha << file.rdbuf( )->is_open( ) << endl;

   file.open( "basic_filebuf_is_open.cpp" );
   cout << file.rdbuf( )->is_open( ) << endl;
}
```

```Output
false
true
```

## <a name="off_type"></a> basic_filebuf::off_type

Makes this type within `basic_filebuf` scope equivalent to the type of the same name in the `Tr` scope.

```cpp
typedef typename traits_type::off_type off_type;
```

## <a name="open"></a> basic_filebuf::open

Opens a file.

```cpp
basic_filebuf<Char_T, Tr> *open(
    const char* filename,
    ios_base::openmode mode,
    int protection = (int)ios_base::_Openprot);

basic_filebuf<Char_T, Tr> *open(
    const char* filename,
    ios_base::openmode mode);

basic_filebuf<Char_T, Tr> *open(
    const wchar_t* filename,
    ios_base::openmode mode,
    int protection = (int)ios_base::_Openprot);

basic_filebuf<Char_T, Tr> *open(
    const wchar_t* filename,
    ios_base::openmode mode);
```

### Parameters

*filename*\
The name of the file to open.

*mode*\
One of the enumerations in [`ios_base::openmode`](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#openmode).

*protection*\
The default file opening protection, equivalent to the *shflag* parameter in [_fsopen, _wfsopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/fsopen-wfsopen.md).

### Return Value

If the buffer is already open, or if the file pointer is a null pointer, the function returns a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns **this**.

### Remarks

This function uses a `FILE *` to back the `basic_filebuf` as though you had called [`fopen/wfopen`](../c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-wfopen.md)`(filename, strmode)`. `strmode` is determined from `mode & ~(`[`ate`](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#openmode) `|` [`binary`](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#openmode)`)`:

- `ios_base::in` becomes `"r"` (open existing file for reading).
- [ios_base::out](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#fmtflags) or `ios_base::out | ios_base::trunc` becomes `"w"` (truncate existing file or create for writing).
- `ios_base::out | app` becomes `"a"` (open existing file for appending all writes).
- `ios_base::in | ios_base::out` becomes `"r+"` (open existing file for reading and writing).
- `ios_base::in | ios_base::out | ios_base::trunc` becomes `"w+"` (truncate existing file or create for reading and writing).
- `ios_base::in | ios_base::out | ios_base::app` becomes `"a+"` (open existing file for reading and for appending all writes).

If `mode & ios_base::binary` is nonzero, the function appends `b` to `strmode` to open a binary stream instead of a text stream.
If `mode & ios_base::ate` is nonzero and the file was succesfully opened, the current location in the stream is positioned at the end of file. If that fails, the file is closed.

If the above operations completed successfully, the file conversion facet is determined: `use_facet<codecvt<Char_T, char, traits_type::`[`state_type`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#state_type)`> >(`[`getloc`](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#getloc)`)`, for use by [underflow](#underflow) and [overflow](#overflow).

If the file could not be succesfully opened, null is returned.

### Example

See [`basic_filebuf::close`](#close) for an example that uses `open`.

## <a name="op_eq"></a> basic_filebuf::operator=

Assign the content of this stream buffer object. This is a move assignment involving an rvalue that doesn't leave a copy behind.

```cpp
basic_filebuf& operator=(basic_filebuf&& right);
```

### Parameters

*right*\
An rvalue reference to a [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md) object.

### Return Value

Returns __*this__.

### Remarks

The member operator replaces the contents of the object by using the contents of *right*, treated as an rvalue reference. For more information, see [Rvalue reference declarator: &&](../cpp/rvalue-reference-declarator-amp-amp.md).

## <a name="overflow"></a> basic_filebuf::overflow

Called when a new character is inserted into a full buffer.

```cpp
virtual int_type overflow(int_type _Meta = traits_type::eof);
```

### Parameters

*_Meta*\
The character to insert into the buffer or `traits_type::eof`.

### Return Value

If the function can't succeed, it returns `traits_type::eof`. Otherwise, it returns `traits_type::`[`not_eof`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#not_eof)`(_Meta)`.

### Remarks

If `_Meta != traits_type::`[`eof`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#eof), the protected virtual member function attempts to insert the element `ch = traits_type::`[`to_char_type`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#to_char_type)`(_Meta)` into the output buffer. It can do so in various ways:

- If a write position is available, it can store the element into the write position and increment the next pointer for the output buffer.

- It can make a write position available by allocating new or additional storage for the output buffer.

- It can convert any pending output in the output buffer, followed by `ch`, by using the file conversion facet `fac` to call `fac.out` as needed. Each produced element `ch` of type *char* is written to the associated stream designated by the file pointer `fp` as if by successive calls of the form `fputc(ch, fp)`. If any conversion or write fails, the function does not succeed.

## <a name="pbackfail"></a> basic_filebuf::pbackfail

Tries to put back an element into the input stream, then make it the current element (pointed to by the next pointer).

```cpp
virtual int_type pbackfail(int_type _Meta = traits_type::eof);
```

### Parameters

*_Meta*\
The character to insert into the buffer, or `traits_type::eof`.

### Return Value

If the function can't succeed, it returns `traits_type::eof`. Otherwise, it returns `traits_type::`[`not_eof`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#not_eof)`(_Meta)`.

### Remarks

The protected virtual member function puts back an element into the input buffer and then makes it the current element (pointed to by the next pointer). If `_Meta == traits_type::`[`eof`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#eof), the element to push back is effectively the one already in the stream before the current element. Otherwise, that element is replaced by `ch = traits_type::`[`to_char_type`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#to_char_type)`(_Meta)`. The function can put back an element in various ways:

- If a `putback` position is available, and the element stored there compares equal to `ch`, it can decrement the next pointer for the input buffer.

- If the function can make a `putback` position available, it can do so, set the next pointer to point at that position, and store `ch` in that position.

- If the function can push back an element onto the input stream, it can do so, such as by calling `ungetc` for an element of type **char**.

## <a name="pos_type"></a> basic_filebuf::pos_type

Makes this type within `basic_filebuf` scope equivalent to the type of the same name in the `Tr` scope.

```cpp
typedef typename traits_type::pos_type pos_type;
```

## <a name="seekoff"></a> basic_filebuf::seekoff

Tries to alter the current positions for the controlled streams.

```cpp
virtual pos_type seekoff(
    off_type _Off,
    ios_base::seekdir _Way,
    ios_base::openmode _Which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out);
```

### Parameters

*_Off*\
The position to seek for relative to *_Way*.

*_Way*\
The starting point for offset operations. See [seekdir](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#seekdir) for possible values.

*_Which*\
Specifies the mode for the pointer position. The default is to allow you to modify the read and write positions.

### Return Value

Returns the new position or an invalid stream position.

### Remarks

The protected virtual member function attempts to alter the current positions for the controlled streams. For an object of class [`basic_filebuf`](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md)`<Char_T, Tr>`, a stream position can be represented by an object of type `fpos_t`, which stores an offset and any state information needed to parse a wide stream. Offset zero refers to the first element of the stream. (An object of type [`pos_type`](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#pos_type) stores at least an `fpos_t` object.)

For a file opened for both reading and writing, both the input and output streams are positioned in tandem. To switch between inserting and extracting, you must call either [`pubseekoff`](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#pubseekoff) or [`pubseekpos`](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#pubseekpos). Calls to `pubseekoff` (and hence to `seekoff`) have various limitations for [text streams](../c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-streams.md), [binary streams](../c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-streams.md), and [wide streams](../c-runtime-library/byte-and-wide-streams.md).

If the file pointer `fp` is a null pointer, the function fails. Otherwise, it attempts to alter the stream position by calling `fseek(fp, _Off, _Way)`. If that function succeeds and the resulting position `fposn` can be determined by calling `fgetpos(fp, &fposn)`, the function succeeds. If the function succeeds, it returns a value of type `pos_type` containing `fposn`. Otherwise, it returns an invalid stream position.

## <a name="seekpos"></a> basic_filebuf::seekpos

Tries to alter the current positions for the controlled streams.

```cpp
virtual pos_type seekpos(
    pos_type _Sp,
    ios_base::openmode _Which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out);
```

### Parameters

*_Sp*\
The position to seek for.

*_Which*\
Specifies the mode for the pointer position. The default is to allow you to modify the read and write positions.

### Return Value

If the file pointer `fp` is a null pointer, the function fails. Otherwise, it attempts to alter the stream position by calling `fsetpos(fp, &fposn)`, where `fposn` is the `fpos_t` object stored in `pos`. If that function succeeds, the function returns `pos`. Otherwise, it returns an invalid stream position. To determine if the stream position is invalid, compare the return value with `pos_type(off_type(-1))`.

### Remarks

The protected virtual member function attempts to alter the current positions for the controlled streams. For an object of class [`basic_filebuf`](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md)`<Char_T, Tr>`, a stream position can be represented by an object of type `fpos_t`, which stores an offset and any state information needed to parse a wide stream. Offset zero refers to the first element of the stream. (An object of type `pos_type` stores at least an `fpos_t` object.)

For a file opened for both reading and writing, both the input and output streams are positioned in tandem. To switch between inserting and extracting, you must call either [`pubseekoff`](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#pubseekoff) or [`pubseekpos`](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#pubseekpos). Calls to `pubseekoff` (and to `seekoff`) have various limitations for text streams, binary streams, and wide streams.

For a wide stream, if any insertions have occurred since the stream was opened, or since the last call to `streampos`, the function calls [overflow](#overflow). It also inserts any sequence needed to restore the initial conversion state, by using the file conversion facet `fac` to call `fac.unshift` as needed. Each produced element `byte` of type **char** is written to the associated stream designated by the file pointer `fp` as if by successive calls of the form `fputc(byte, fp)`. If the call to `fac.unshift` or any write fails, the function does not succeed.

## <a name="setbuf"></a> basic_filebuf::setbuf

Performs an operation particular to each derived stream buffer.

```cpp
virtual basic_streambuf<Char_T, Tr> *setbuf(
    char_type* _Buffer,
    streamsize count);
```

### Parameters

*_Buffer*\
Pointer to a buffer.

*count*\
Size of the buffer.

### Return Value

The protected member function returns zero if the file pointer `fp` is a null pointer.

### Remarks

`setbuf` calls `setvbuf( fp, (char*) _Buffer, _IOFBF, count * sizeof( Char_T))` to offer the array of `count` elements beginning at *_Buffer* as a buffer for the stream. If that function returns a nonzero value, the function returns a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns **this** to signal success.

## <a name="swap"></a> basic_filebuf::swap

Exchanges the contents of this `basic_filebuf` for the contents of the provided `basic_filebuf`.

```cpp
void swap(basic_filebuf& right);
```

### Parameters

*right*\
An lvalue reference to another `basic_filebuf`.

## <a name="sync"></a> basic_filebuf::sync

Tries to synchronize the controlled streams with any associated external streams.

```cpp
virtual int sync();
```

### Return Value

Returns zero if the file pointer `fp` is a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns zero only if calls to both [overflow](#overflow) and `fflush(fp)` succeed in flushing any pending output to the stream.

## <a name="traits_type"></a> basic_filebuf::traits_type

Associates a type name with the `Tr` template parameter.

```cpp
typedef Tr traits_type;
```

## <a name="underflow"></a> basic_filebuf::underflow

Extracts the current element from the input stream.

```cpp
virtual int_type underflow();
```

### Return Value

If the function can't succeed, it returns `traits_type::`[`eof`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#eof). Otherwise, it returns `ch`, converted as described in the Remarks section.

### Remarks

The protected virtual member function attempts to extract the current element `ch` from the input stream, and return the element as `traits_type::`[`to_int_type`](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#to_int_type)`(ch)`. It can do so in various ways:

- If a read position is available, it takes `ch` as the element stored in the read position and advances the next pointer for the input buffer.

- It can read one or more elements of type **char**, as if by successive calls of the form `fgetc(fp)`, and convert them to an element `ch` of type `Char_T` by using the file conversion facet `fac` to call `fac.in` as needed. If any read or conversion fails, the function does not succeed.
